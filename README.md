<think>I'll create a high-level README.md for the GitHub repository that covers the key information about the project without delving into the SSR implementation details. I'll focus on:

1. Brief introduction to the project
2. Technology stack
3. Key features
4. Setup instructions
5. Basic development commands
6. Contributing guidelines (if relevant)
7. License information

I'll use a more visually appealing format with badges, clear headings, and concise descriptions to make it GitHub-friendly.</think># Wharton E-Club Website
